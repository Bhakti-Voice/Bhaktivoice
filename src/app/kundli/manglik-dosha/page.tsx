      question: "What is Manglik Dosha (Kuja Dosha) in Vedic Astrology?",
      answer:
        "Manglik Dosha (also termed Kuja Dosha or Bhauma Dosha) is an astrological combination occurring when Mars (Mangal) is situated in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, or 12th house from the Ascendant (Lagna), natal Moon, or Venus in a birth chart. Because Mars governs passion, aggression, and raw fire, its placement in houses connected to marriage and temperament demands careful assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between Anshik Manglik and Purna Manglik?",
      answer:
        "Purna (High) Manglik occurs when Mars is placed in the primary marriage houses (7th or 8th house) from Lagna without benefic aspects or classical cancellations. Anshik (Partial / Mild) Manglik occurs when Mars is situated in secondary houses (such as the 12th, 2nd, or 4th house) or present only from the Moon/Venus. Anshik Manglik has a gentle impact and rarely creates severe marital friction.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can a Manglik person marry a Non-Manglik person?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Classical treatises confirm that marriage between a Manglik and non-Manglik is completely viable if: (1) One of the 16 classical cancellation rules applies, (2) The Ashtakoot Guna Milan score is 18 or above with healthy Bhakoot and Nadi harmony, or (3) The partner's horoscope has Saturn, Rahu, or Mars balancing the corresponding sensitive house.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the 16 classical cancellations (Apavadas) for Kuja Dosha?",
      answer:
        "Authored in classical texts like Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and Muhurta Chintamani, key cancellations include: Mars in Aries in 1st house (Ruchaka Yoga), Mars in Scorpio in 4th house, Mars in Capricorn in 7th house (Exalted), Mars in Sagittarius/Pisces in 8th house, Jupiter's 5th/7th/9th aspect on Mars, Moon-Mars conjunction (Chandra-Mangala Yoga), and Mars in movable cardinal signs.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the most authentic Vedic remedies for Manglik Dosha?",
      answer:
        "The most effective classical remedies include daily recitation of Sri Hanuman Chalisa or Sundarkand on Tuesdays, chanting the Mangal Beej Mantra ('Om Kram Kreem Kroum Sah Bhaumaya Namah') 108 times, observing Tuesday salt-free sweet fasts, donating red lentils (masoor dal) or copper to the needy, and performing Kumbha Vivah before wedding rites in high-severity cases.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should someone with Manglik Dosha wear a Red Coral (Moonga)?",
      answer:
        "No, never wear Red Coral blindly to cure Manglik Dosha! Coral amplifies Martian energy. It should only be worn if Mars is an auspicious functional benefic (Yogakaraka) for your ascendant (specifically Cancer or Leo Lagna), evaluated by an expert astrologer.",

          <p>
            In Vedic astrology (Jyotish), Mars represents courage, vitality, blood, passion, and ambition.
            When Mars aligns with houses that govern marital harmony, emotional sharing, and domestic life
            (houses 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 12), its intense heat can create assertiveness or impatience.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, popular folklore often misrepresents Manglik Dosha as a feared curse. Ancient masters like
            <strong> Maharshi Parashara</strong> and <strong>Varahamihira</strong> provided precise rules
            of cancellation (<em>Apavadas</em>). In reality, more than 60% of apparent Manglik horoscopes
            possess complete cancellation due to planetary exaltation, own-sign strength, or Jupiter&apos;s
            protective glance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our engine conducts a rigorous <strong>Tripada Vichara</strong> (evaluating Mars from the Ascendant,
            natal Moon, and Venus) to give you an authentic, fear-free understanding of your horoscope.
